# Snopcare.ShoppingList

Exercise was to create a shopping list with following challenges:
  - Add input field to add new list items
  - Add Enter button
  - Add delete button close to every line items ( existent and new)
  - Functionality to add List items entered in the input field either by clicking on the Enter button or by keyboard key Enter.
  - Existing List items
  - Add functionality to line-through "done" shopping list items following toggle approach.
  - Add functionality to delete line items via the delete button.
  
Writing the code I followed below organized structure:

1. Define variables using DOM to select the elements in the HTML file.
2. Write down all the functions needed to:
  a. create LI for enter button, for input field, for delete button.
  b. define action when clicking enter on keyboard, enter button, delete button.
  c. define action when clicking a list item = line-through
3. Implement eventlisteners for button, input field, click on LI and delete button.
4. Create Loops
